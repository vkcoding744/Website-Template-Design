    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <p>
        This book continues my exploration of HTML5. My approach in developing the projects
        was to combine features such as canvas and video, attempt more intricate drawing by
        using mathematics, and use standard programming techniques such as object-oriented
        programming and separation of content and logic. I was also interested in building
        applications combining HTML5 and JavaScript with other technologies, including
        Google Maps.
        Each chapter in the book is focused on an application or set of related applications.
        This is because my experience as a teacher and a learner has shown that concepts
        and mechanics are best understood in the context of actual use. The applications start
        off with drawing the HTML5 official logo. As you will find out in Chapter 1, the way I
        developed this application prompted use of coordinate transformations.
        The project in Chapter 2, involving a family collage, was inspired by my growing
        family and the desire to teach about object-oriented programming. It is a good
        application for you to use as a foundation to create your own, with your own photos
        and objects of your own invention. Chapter 3, which shows how to create a bouncing
        video, was built on other two-dimensional applications I have created, and features two
        different ways to combine canvas and video.
        Chapters 4 and 5 demonstrate use of the Google Maps API (Application
        Programming Interface), a powerful facility that allows you to incorporate access
        to Google Maps as part of your own projects. Chapter 4 presents a user interface
        combining map and canvas and includes a custom-designed cursor and the use of alpha
        (transparency) in drawing paths. The map quiz in Chapter 5 demonstrates the use of
        mapping as a portal to media. The application shows you how to separate content and
        logic so you can scale up to various applications (e.g., a tour of a region or a geography
        quiz with many locations).
        Chapter 6 features a game called Add to 15, which turned out to be an excellent
        example of arrays. It also demonstrated the necessity to prepare for bad behavior on the
        part of players. <br>

        <h1>Project History and Critical Requirements</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        The critical requirements for this project are somewhat artificial and not easily stated as
        something separate from HTML. For example, I wanted to draw the logo as opposed to
        copying an image from the Web. My design objectives always include wanting to practice
        programming and prepare examples for my students. The shape of the shield part of
        the logo seemed amenable to drawing on canvas and the HTML letters could be done
        using the draw text feature. In addition, there are practical advantages to drawing images
        instead of using image files. Separate files need to be managed, stored, and downloaded.
        The image shown in Figure 1-4 is 90KB. The file holding the code for the program is only
        4KB. Drawing a logo or other graphic means that the scale and other attributes can be
        changed dynamically using code.
